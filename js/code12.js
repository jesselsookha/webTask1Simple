Variables 

let     - current way to declare 
const   - constant variable declaration - can't change during execution 
var     - old style to declare 

variables are dynamically typed - they can store any value 

but there are 8 types we should have an understanding for 

number  - for both integer and floating-point 
bigint  - for integers of arbitrary length
strings - for strings (& characters)
boolean - for logical values - true and false 
null    - a single value - empty - bothing - does not exist 
undefined - a single value - not assigned 
object and symbol - for complex data structures and unique identifiers
